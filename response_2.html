				matches (A match), has no doubt about his ability to participate

				The actual World Cup entry was announced on the 13th, but there was a happening that the Iranian

				Iranian media speculated that "the Iranian government is pressuring the Iranian Football Association and

				In response, foreign media, including AFP, interpreted it as "an intention to express their support for

				German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made a point of asking the Iranian government, which violently suppresses
				anti-government protests, "What kind of government is shooting at its own people?"
				"Those who act like this should expect our resistance," he said in a national video podcast released on
				the
				same day. "We are on the side of the Iranian citizens."
				"We see the fight for freedom and justice in Iran's streets, lecture rooms and courts," Scholz said. "We
				are
				also witnessing Iranian drones attacking and killing Ukrainian cities. This is absolutely unacceptable,"
				he
				said.
				EU member states agreed over the weekend to impose additional sanctions on Iran, he said.
				"Considering cruelty and contempt for humanity, words are not enough," he said. "The EU will impose
				additional sanctions next week to strengthen pressure on the Iranian revolutionary army and political

				Jeff Blatter, a former FIFA president, thought Iran should not play in the World Cup.

				Cup is
				all over, and now the players have joined the national team and left or left for Qatar.
				The World Cup is a festival for people all over the world. The purpose of the tournament is also clear,
				including world peace through soccer and harmony among participating countries. However, the Qatar World
				Cup
				was talkative even before the start. There were problems with the human rights and treatment of workers
				who
				died in the process of building the stadium while preparing for the World Cup, and the local atmosphere
				that
				was not free due to the nature of Qatar affected by Islam. The issue of corruption has also been pointed
				out. Some criticized that players, especially players who play in European leagues, are overworked due
				to
				the first World Cup held in winter. In addition, many other horses ran like tags.
