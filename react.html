		As authorities bloody suppressed the protests and hundreds of casualties, Azmun criticized it as "a disgrace to
		kill women and people in Iran."
		"If the punishment for this is excluding the national team, it is nothing," he said, adding that he would not
		mind if he was not allowed to play in the World Cup.
		Azmun, who scored 41 goals in 65 national team matches (A match), has no doubt about his ability to participate
		in the World Cup, but it is predicted that he may be excluded from the national team due to his political
		position.
		The actual World Cup entry was announced on the 13th, but there was a happening that the Iranian Football
		Association postponed to the next day because Queiroz did not appear at the press conference.
		Iranian media speculated that "the Iranian government is pressuring the Iranian Football Association and Queiroz
		not to take players who supported the recent anti-government protests, including Azmun, to the World Cup."

		Famous Iranian actress Tarane Alidusti (38) has joined Iran's anti-government protests,
		which began with "the mysterious death of hijab," revealing her naked hijab on social media. <br>
		On the 9th (local time), AFP reported that Alidusti posted a picture of himself taking off his hijab and
		exposing his long hair on Instagram. <br>
		In the photo, Alidusti holds a piece of paper that reads "Women, Life and Freedom" in the language of the ethnic
		Kurds. <br>
		In Iran, anti-government protests have continued for nearly two months over the suspicious death of a Kurdish
		woman,
		Mahsa Amini, 22, in September for not wearing a hijab properly in downtown Tehran, the capital. <br>
		According to Iran's Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA), 318 protesters, including 46 minors, were killed.
		<br>
		"Women, life, and freedom" emphasized by Alidusti is a phrase in honor of Amini.

		Iranian players who participated in the 2022 FIFA Qatar World Cup did not sing along when the national anthem
		was played before the start of the game and remained silent.
		In the first Group B match between Iran and England at Khalifa International Stadium in Alayan, Qatar, on the
		21st (local time), all Iranian football players did not sing along with the national anthem played before the
		start of the match. Usually, when the national anthem is played, local broadcast cameras shoot each player
		closely, and all Iranian players stared at the front with their mouths closed.
		In response, foreign media, including AFP, interpreted it as "an intention to express their support for
		anti-government protests in Iran." In fact, Alireza Jahanbach, the captain of the Iranian national team,
		explained, "We decided not to sing along to the national anthem and decided to mark the protesters with
		solidarity."

		The Iranian government has now cut off Internet connections to prevent the spread of protests. Therefore, social
		media such as WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram are also unavailable.
		As a result, Iranian citizens are communicating with difficulty using virtual private networks (VPNs).
		Reporters are also being arrested. Reporters who took photos of Mahsa Amini at the scene, and those who used the
		photos in the article, were all arrested. They didn't have the right to an attorney. If someone defends them,
		the lawyer is also arrested.

		Foreign media, including the Guardian, reported on the 16th (local time) that Iranian police are shooting at
		passengers and beating women on SNS amid three months of anti-government protests triggered by the suspicious
		death of Iranian female college student Mahsa Amini (22).
		The first video, which appears to have been filmed at a subway station in Tehran, Iran, is 16 seconds long, and
		begins with many citizens on the platform flocking in one direction with customers down. There is also a
		dizzying sight of a group of citizens falling and following citizens hitting it. Some citizens who have not been
		able to keep up with the evacuees lie close to the floor of the platform.
		Foreign media reported that Iranian police fired at citizens at subway stations. It has not been confirmed
		whether any casualties have occurred due to this.

		Iran's court sentenced six people to death in connection with the incident, amid three months of anti-government

		According to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency on the 20th (local time), famous Iranian actors Hengame Ghaziani
		and Qatayun Riahi were arrested on charges of inciting protests and communicating with opposition media.

		German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made a point of asking the Iranian government, which violently suppresses
		anti-government protests, "What kind of government is shooting at its own people?"
		"Those who act like this should expect our resistance," he said in a national video podcast released on the same
		day. "We are on the side of the Iranian citizens."
		"We see the fight for freedom and justice in Iran's streets, lecture rooms and courts," Scholz said. "We are
		also witnessing Iranian drones attacking and killing Ukrainian cities. This is absolutely unacceptable," he
		said.
		EU member states agreed over the weekend to impose additional sanctions on Iran, he said.
		"Considering cruelty and contempt for humanity, words are not enough," he said. "The EU will impose additional
		sanctions next week to strengthen pressure on the Iranian revolutionary army and political leadership."

		Swiss federal government
		The two petitions were signed by more than 25,000 Swiss citizens.
		The purpose of the two petitions is that Western countries should join the additional sanctions imposed on Iran,

		Jeff Blatter, a former FIFA president, thought Iran should not play in the World Cup.
		The 2022 FIFA Qatar World Cup is only six days away. After Canada, all 32 countries that advanced to the World
		Cup finals have completed submitting their roster. The final league schedule ahead of the World Cup is all over,
		and now the players have joined the national team and left or left for Qatar.
		The World Cup is a festival for people all over the world. The purpose of the tournament is also clear,
		including world peace through soccer and harmony among participating countries. However, the Qatar World Cup was
		talkative even before the start. There were problems with the human rights and treatment of workers who died in
		the process of building the stadium while preparing for the World Cup, and the local atmosphere that was not
		free due to the nature of Qatar affected by Islam. The issue of corruption has also been pointed out. Some
		criticized that players, especially players who play in European leagues, are overworked due to the first World
		Cup held in winter. In addition, many other horses ran like tags.
