						<li>Suppression of Muslim women's human rights</li>

				<p class="summary text-center">
					Iran has banned women from watching professional football matches since 1981, after the 1979 Islamic
					Revolution.
					The Islamic law that men and women should not be together in public is applied, and it is a
					justification that
					male fans should be protected from obscene acts, but it was actually a discriminatory custom for
					women.
					Since then, as calls for eliminating discrimination against women grew, female spectators were
					allowed to enter in August, 41 years later.
					However, you have to sit and watch in a women-only area without choosing the seat you want. Under
					the Taliban,
					women were deprived of even basic educational opportunities. Girls are not given any education after
					the age of eight,
					and girls under the age of 16 are allowed to marry. In this country, 80% of marriages are forced.
					Women must accompany their male relatives
					when they go outside, and taxis or buses cannot be used alone.

				<p class="text-center">
					In response to a recent report by the Christian Science Monitor that European women are voluntarily
					converting to Islam,
					Muslim missionaries pointed out the reality of human rights problems faced by Muslim women, saying,
					"It is a strange phenomenon
					caused by not knowing Islamic doctrines properly."

					he Christian Science Monitor recently reported that thousands of European women have converted to
					Islam every year since the September 11 attacks,
					and they decide to convert mainly because of their interest in Islamic doctrine itself. The
					newspaper analyzed that this phenomenon is aimed at
					achieving mental stability along with disappointment in the secularized European society.

					Pastor Lee Man-seok, who served in Iran, a Muslim country for 19 years, said, "Women with religious
					curio
					sity and passion may have been touched by Muslim women wearing Chador or attracted only by the
					beautiful appearance of Islam," adding,
					"If Islamic doctrines and prominent Muslim scholars know how to see women, they will think
					differently."

					"Women in the Middle East have begun to feel the seriousness of their situation as education
					improves and the Internet and broadcasting influence,"
					said Kim Do-heun, general secretary of the Middle East Mission (Middle East Church, 2007). "Women
					outside the Islamic world need to take a closer look
					at the causes of the changes."

					<h2>
						<li>Chadur is for men</li>
					</h2>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-center">
					Ordinary Muslim clerics and Muslims insist that Chadur be worn to protect women from the culture of
					the division.
					But Islamic scholars argue that the Chadur is to protect the purity of men who see women.

					Some scholars view women's hands, faces, and even women themselves as attracting men. Scholars such
					as Malikiyah and Hanafiyah oppose women's makeup,
					warning that "a naturally beautiful woman without makeup can be seduced by men just by looking at
					her face."

					Another scholar sees the woman herself as an aura (Aurah, the external genitals of women) and argues
					that the devil welcomes her when she comes out of the house.
					In other words, women have to stay indoors or wear chador when they go out to avoid seducing men.

					Pakistan's Isar Ahmad, known for the movement "Let's Go Back to Quran," saw the origin of
					"Chardiwar," which means four walls, and insisted that women should
					always be trapped in four walls. There is also an opinion that Chadur should be trapped inside the
					tent even when going out because it means "tenture" in Persian.

						<li>Wife's Position in Islamic Home</li>
					</h2>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-center">
					Quran 4:3 restricts having up to four wives, but does not restrict marriage to slave women who are
					treated as possessions. The esteemed Muslim scholar Ghazali reports,
					"Omar's son takes three slave girls before his last meal, and Ali, the most ascetic of his
					colleagues, has four wives and 17 slave girls as concubines."

					In addition, the Koran explains that the reason for having four wives is to solve gender imbalance
					and social problems caused by wars or accidents. However, Muhammad married
					as many as 22 wives, and at the time of his death, he had nine wives. Muhammad's third wife, Aisha,
					married Muhammad, who was 53 when she was only nine years old.

						<li>A Muslim paradise with 72 maidens</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="text-center">
					In Islam, those who sacrificed their wealth and lives for Allah and Prophet Muhammad say that if
					they go to the underworld, they can live with 72 beautiful women with big eyes.
					Two of them say they can take the best wife on earth, and all the beauties soon return to their
					maiden state.

					In addition, if a virgin is executed for a crime, she cannot go to heaven by her husband, so a
					person with good Islamic faith takes away her virginity. In Iran, this is still
					done by the customary law called tajavoz.

						<li>Contractual marriage and dowry</li>
					</h2>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-center">
					Islamic law allows people to go on a long business trip or temporarily marry at any time with a down
					payment if necessary. As a result, women who are pregnant by contractual
					marriage are becoming a social problem in Islamic countries. This is because at the end of the
					contract period, they are not responsible for any problems that have occurred.
					Women who know they are pregnant after the contract is over and children who will be born in the
					future have no one to blame.

					When Muslims marry, they pay money or goods to a bride or family, which is called a wedding dowry.
					Marriage funds are exchanged in exchange for benefits from women, also called
					remuneration, and marriages without this marriage fund are invalid. These acts are legally
					recognized by any denomination.

				<h1 class="title">Five unknow and misunderstood issues about women in Islam</h1>
				<br>
				<img class="img-fluid w-75 center" src="assets/images/article3_5.jpeg">
				<br>
				<h2>1. Patriarchal traditions colored the early and dominant interpretations of the Qur’an</h2>
				<p class="text-center">
					The foundations of Islamic Law are based on the Qur’an. In addition, the Sunnah (the hadith and the
					example of the prophet) is used as a secondary source for further clarification
					and guidance. When the Qur’an and Sunnah leave an issue unresolved, Muslim scholars resort to
					ijtihad – the science of interpretations and rule making, where they can supplement
					Islamic Law with local customs. Naturally, scholars from different communities and schools of
					thought disagree in their ijtihad, which is unobjectionable as long as these
					scholarships are based on religious and linguistic knowledge and are conducted piously and in good
					faith. While Muslims are free to choose the interpretations most convincing
					to them, it is inevitable that these individual ijtihads are influenced by the patriarchal customs
					and beliefs of their surroundings.1

					It is therefore evident that Muslim jurists are a product of their societies, where the central
					patriarchal concept that men are superior to women influenced understanding
					of Qur’anic texts. As such, these ijtihads are a product of their times and patriarchal
					circumstances, and need to be addressed and re-evaluated. In the words of Dr. Asma Lambrabet,
					a leading figure in revising Islamic texts from feminist perspectives; “Islamic thought should
					evolve in order to redefine and rethink itself, and to make the necessary
					distinction between the spiritual message and certain interpretations that have frozen the text,
					occasionally suffocating its true message.”
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>2. Alternative non-patriarchal interpretations of the Qur’an do exist</h2>
				<p class="text-center">
					As many Islamic scholars point out, the Qur’an clearly instates the principle of equality among all
					humans. In the Qur’an (Qur’an 49:13, among other verses), God created
					humans from male and female, and despite the empirical differences among humans (based on race,
					gender, etc.), the Qur’an regards them as equals and only ranks humans based
					on their moral choices and piety. God created men and women from the same soul, as guardians of each
					other in a relationship of cooperation not domination.4

					However, while some specific verses at face value seems to be promoting male dominance, alternative
					interpretations are important to consider. For example, one the most
					controversial and most commonly cited Qur’anic verse to justify male dominance is the 34th ayah in
					surat al-Nisa’, which is most commonly interpreted as “men are the
					protectors and maintainers” (original: qawwamun, other possible interpretations: advisors, providers
					of guidance) “of women,” “because” (original: bima, other possible
					interpretations: in circumstances where) “they are superior to them” (original: faddala, other
					possible interpretations: have a feature that the other lacks) “and because”
					(original: bima, other possible interpretations: in circumstances where) “they support them from
					their means.”5

					The popular interpretation understood in light of patriarchal hierarchal traditions, as al-Hibri
					demonstrates, can be completely different once patriarchal assumptions
					are eliminated. In this case, the Qur’an was describing a specific situation observed at that time,
					where a man takes the responsibility of an advisory role if both these
					conditions are present; first if the man has an ability that a particular woman lacks, and second
					when the man is maintaining that particular woman, meanwhile the woman is
					free to reject the advice. Based on the rules of Islamic jurisprudence, when one verse is specific
					to certain circumstances, the more general principle of equality (outlined above)
					is to be taken as the general rule while the particular instance as the exception.6

					It is important to note herein that this is only one example and there are numerous other cases
					where the dominant patriarchal interpretations are disputed by feminist Islamic
					jurisprudence scholars. While family law and personal status codes in Arab and Muslim countries
					restrict women’s rights and freedoms (e.g., in choosing a husband, guardianship/
					wali, obeying the husband/ ta’ah, initiating divorce, dowry requirement, polygamy, marriage to
					non-Muslims, etc.), alternative interpretations of the Qur’an dispute these claims
					of male domination based on religious texts (see al-Hibri7).
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>3. Context matters</h2>
				<p class="text-center">
					The mainstream interpretations of Qur’anic text that consider men superior to women are therefore
					not objective but subjective human interpretations heavily influenced
					by historic and geopolitical conditions. In addition, Qur’anic verses in many instances are revealed
					in very specific circumstances, and need to be understood based on
					contextual terms.

					For example, surat al-Baqara 282, is another of the commonly cited verses to claim male superiority
					in Islam. The verse, revealed in a business context, states that
					“when you enter a transaction involving a debt for a fixed period reduce it to writing and let a
					scribe write it down between you in fairness … and bring two witnesses from
					among your men. Should there not be two men, then a man and two women of the women you choose to be
					witnesses.” If taken out of context, this verse could be interpreted to suggest
					that a woman’s testimony is not equal to that of a man’s. However, considering the specific
					situation of a business transaction and the larger context in which women at the time
					were not involved or experts in business affairs, this verse should not be taken as evidence that
					women are not equal to men in Islam. In fact, in another instance, the second
					successor to the Prophet, Umar ibin Khattab, appointed a woman to manage the affairs of a market in
					Medina.8

					Therefore, verses of the Qur’an need to be taken in the contexts in which they were revealed, as the
					Qur’an takes the specific circumstances of the societal conditions into
					consideration.9 These specific verses are products of their times and contexts, and need not be
					forced onto different times and different contexts. Moreover, the Qur’anic verses
					need to be looked at in a wholesome manner and not taken in isolation from other texts and verses.
					In fact, the five main schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence
					(Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi’i, Hanbali, and Ja’fari), formally adopted by Muslim countries, agree on four
					basic principles of Islamic law; it changes with time and place, must serve
					the public interest, should not cause harm, and may be discarded if its cause has faded.10 This is
					clear evidence that some verses which were revealed in specific circumstances
					should not be taken out of context and generalized as the rule for all times and places.
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>4. Muslim women’s rights are attainable through Islam</h2>
				<p class="text-center">
					According to Dr. al-Hibri, the Islamic philosophy of change embraces gradual change, and is linked
					to the principle of shura where societal affairs are conducted in consultation.
					The Islamic philosophy of change is also linked to the important Qur’anic principle of no compulsion
					in the matters of faith. Gradualism, shura, and aversion to coercion are
					important Islamic principles that are most appropriate to advance the rights of Muslim women.
					Gradual stable change to the status and rights of Muslim women is therefore
					achievable through Islam. Two of the agreed upon principles of Islamic law: rationality (‘illah;
					when a reason for a law disappears, so must the law) and public interest
					(maslahah; Islamic laws must serve the public interests, including those of women) are important
					foundations for revising patriarchal laws and re-engaging in ijtihad.11 As such,
					Muslim women’s rights can be attained through these Islamic jurisprudential principles and
					requirements.
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>5. Liberation must come from within the Islamic domain</h2>
				<p class="text-center">
					As al-Hibri points out, Muslims women tend to be religious, and would not react well to a western
					feminist perspective that is imposed upon them, therefore secular approaches
					to women’s rights are not likely to ‘liberate’ Muslim women because people of faith will continue to
					want to follow their perception of the Divine Will.12 In addition, many
					scholars argue that there is no universal model of gender quality (‘one size fits all’), and the
					West should not keep a monopoly on the topographies of modernity and truth.13

					In this context, liberation and change must come from within the Islamic sphere, where Muslim women
					have a proactive and autonomous role in reform, re-reading of the Qur’an,
					and revealing the historical prejudices that colored the understanding of the Qur’anic message. In
					an environment of religious devotion, liberation must be rooted in the roots
					of the Qur’an.
