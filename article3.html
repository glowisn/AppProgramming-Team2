                <p class="summary">
                    Sixteen UN-appointed independent human rights experts encouraged Iranian authorities on Friday to
                    stop indicting people with charges punishable by death for participating in peaceful demonstrations.

                    “We urge Iranian authorities to stop using the death penalty as a tool to squash protests and
                    reiterate our call to immediately release all protesters who have been arbitrarily deprived of their
                    liberty for the sole reason of exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of opinion and
                    expression, association and peaceful assembly and for their actions to promote and protect human
                    rights and fundamental freedoms through peaceful means”, they said in a statement.

                    In Tehran province, eight people were charged by the Islamic Revolution Court on 29 October with
                    crimes carrying the death penalty, namely “waging war against God” or “moharebeh” and “corruption on
                    earth”.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Two days later, the Tehran prosecutor announced that some 1,000 indictments had been issued in
                    connection with recent “riots” in the province and that public trials were scheduled for a number of
                    people “in the coming days”.

                    <br>

                    In blatant violation of the separation of powers, on 6 November, 227 members of Parliament called on
                    the judiciary to act decisively against those arrested during the protests and to carry out the
                    death penalty punishments.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    “With the continuous repression of protests, many more indictments on charges carrying the death
                    penalty and death sentences might soon be issued, and we fear that women and girls, who have been at
                    the forefront of protests, and especially women human rights defenders, who have been arrested and
                    jailed for demanding the end of systemic and systematic discriminatory laws, policies and practices
                    might be particularly targeted”, they warned.

                    Through grossly unfair summary trials, the Islamic Revolutionary courts have been used for years to
                    sentence political activists, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders, according to the
                    experts.

                    The country’s criminal justice system relies heavily on confessions extracted through torture and
                    other forms of coercion and duress to prove guilt.

                    <br>
                    Since nationwide protests in November 2019, the death penalty has been used widely under
                    unsubstantiated murder or vague national security charges against individuals for participating in
                    demonstrations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2020, at least two individuals were executed following their participation in protests.

                    “We reiterate our call on the Human Rights Council to urgently take the necessary actions to hold a
                    Special Session on the situation in Iran and to establish an international investigative mechanism,
                    to ensure accountability in Iran and to end the persistent impunity for grave human rights
                    violations”, they stated.
