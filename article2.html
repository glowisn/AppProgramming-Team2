                    The experiences of Muslim women (Arabic: مسلمات Muslimāt, singular مسلمة Muslimah) vary widely
                    between and within different societies. At the same time, their adherence to Islam is a shared
                    factor that affects their lives to a varying degree and gives them a common identity that may serve
                    to bridge the wide cultural, social, and economic differences between them.

                    Many women are mentioned in the Quran, but only one is named: Mary, who appears more times in the
                    Quran than in the Bible. According to the Quran, divine grace surrounded Mary from birth, and, as
                    a young woman, she received a message from God through the archangel Gabriel that God had chosen
                    her, purified her and preferred her above all "the women of the worlds".

                    Among the influences which have played an important role in defining the social, legal, spiritual,
                    and cosmological status of women in the course of Islamic history are the sacred scriptures of
                    Islam: the Quran; the ḥadīth, which are traditions relating to the deeds and aphorisms attributed
                    to the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions; ijmā', which is a scholarly consensus,
                    expressed or tacit, on a question of law; qiyās, the principle by which the laws of the Quran
                    and the sunnah or prophetic custom are applied to situations not explicitly covered by these two
                    sources of legislation; and fatwā, non-binding published opinions or decisions regarding
                    religious doctrine or points of law. Additional influences include pre-Islamic cultural traditions;
                    secular laws, which are fully accepted in Islam so long as they do not directly contradict Islamic
                    precepts; religious authorities, including government-controlled agencies such as the Indonesian
                    Ulema Council and Turkey's Diyanet; and spiritual teachers, which are particularly prominent in
                    Islamic mysticism or Sufism. Many of the latter, including the medieval Muslim philosopher Ibn
                    Arabi, have themselves produced texts that have elucidated the metaphysical symbolism of the
                    feminine principle in Islam.

                    There is considerable variation as to how the above religious and legal sources are interpreted
                    within the Sunni branch of Islam. In particular, extremist and fundamentalist Sunni movements
                    such as Wahhabis and Salafists tend to reject Islamic mysticism and theology outright; this has
                    profound implications for the way that women are perceived within these ideological sects.
                    Conversely, within Islamic Orthodoxy, both the established theological schools and Sufism are at
                    least somewhat influential.

                    Within Sunni Islam, women are provided a number of guidelines prescribed by the Quran and ḥadīth
                    literature, as understood by fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), as well as in accordance with the
                    interpretations derived from the ḥadīth that were agreed upon by majority of Sunni Muslim scholars
                    as authentic beyond doubt based on ḥadīth studies. The Quran holds that men and women have
                    equal moral agency and they both receive equal rewards in the afterlife. These interpretations
                    and their application were shaped by the historical context of the Muslim world at the time they
                    were written.

                    During his life, Muhammad married nine or eleven women, depending upon the differing accounts of who
                    were his wives. In pre-Islamic Arabian culture, marriage was generally contracted in accordance with
                    the larger needs of the tribe and was based on the need to form alliances within the tribe and with
                    other tribes. Virginity at the time of marriage was emphasized as a tribal honor. William
                    Montgomery Watt states that all of Muhammad's marriages had the political aspect of strengthening
                    friendly relationships and were based on the pre-Islamic Arabian custom.
